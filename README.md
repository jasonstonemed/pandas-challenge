# School Data Analysis with Pandas

## Overview

This Python script uses the Pandas library to perform data analysis on school and student data. It calculates various summary statistics and generates reports for district-wide and individual school performance. The analysis includes information on school budgets, student scores, and passing rates.

## Instructions

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including Pandas.

2. **Data Files**: Make sure you have the school and student data files in the specified format. You can adjust the file paths in the code if needed.

3. **Data Loading**: The script loads the school and student data from CSV files using `pd.read_csv`. Ensure that the file paths (`school_data_to_load` and `student_data_to_load`) are correctly set to point to your data files.

4. **Data Analysis**: The script performs the following analyses:

   - District Summary: Calculates district-wide statistics, including the total number of schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and passing rates.
   - School Summary: Calculates statistics for each school, including per-student budget, average math and reading scores, passing rates for math and reading, and an overall passing rate.
   - Top and Bottom Performing Schools: Identifies the top and bottom-performing schools based on overall passing rates.
   - Math and Reading Scores by Grade: Separates and analyzes math and reading scores by grade level.
   - Scores by School Spending: Categorizes schools based on spending per student and calculates summary statistics for each spending category.
   - Scores by School Size: Categorizes schools based on size (small, medium, or large) and calculates summary statistics for each category.
   - Scores by School Type: Categorizes schools as charter or district and calculates summary statistics for each type.

5. **Output**: The script generates DataFrames and displays them to the console. You can further customize the output format as needed.

## Usage

You can adapt and extend this code for your specific school district or educational dataset by adjusting file paths or adding additional analyses. Simply run the script in a Python environment to perform the data analysis.
