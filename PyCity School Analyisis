PyCity Schools Analysis
In conclusion, schools with a higher budget did not produce better test results overall. Schools with higher spending per student (647âˆ’675) underperformed in comparison to schools with smaller budgets (585). Further analysis of how student spending is allocated might yield information to explain this effect.
In whole, small/medium sized schools considerably outperformed larger schools in math performance by a margin of 89/91% vs 67%. Further analysis of the relationship between school size and budget per student may yield predictors of school performance.
As a whole, charter schools significantly out-performed the public district schools across all metrics, with exception of Average Reading where there was a margin of three points (84% to 81%). However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
